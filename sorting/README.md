# Sorting Algorithms

## Quick Sort[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort]:

Algorithm:
1. Pick pivot element
2. Partition:
    - Reorder array so that elements less in value than pivot come before, and values
    greater than pivot come after
    - elements equal in value can go before or after
3. Recursively apply 1 and 2 to each arrays created before and after pivot

## Merge Sort:
